AFC [n.] Average Frustrated Chump. A guy who lacks skills, and confidence when it comes to women. He will often ends up in the "friend zone" because he obeys girls like a slave. (An AFC in a bar with gorgeous women would sit in the corner, and ask himeself "why aren't they coming up to me." when he should be going up to them, but won't, because he lacks confidence.)
bic [n.] A 'Bic' is the most common type of lighter available. Tried, trusted and relatively inexpensive, it's the only type of lighter I use. (Pass me the Bic, so I can light my cone.)
bail [vi.] to leave; to bounce
beauty sus [n.] The opposite of beauty bias, where the attractiveness of a person makes you more suspicious about their true character, usually causing you to act more closed off or cold around that person than usual because of their beauty, thus the sus. (-Do you have something against them? Is there some kind of beef going on that I don't know about? -Nothing really, I just don't trust them. Beauty sus I guess, they're just too hot to not be some kind of freak if you ask me.)
brb [] Acronym for "be right back"
beta male [] An unremarkable, careful man who avoids risk and confrontation. Beta males lack the physical presence, charisma and confidence of the Alpha male. (Pete knew he was losing the girl he'd just met at the bar to the guy who bought her a drink, but he was too much of a beta male to do anything about it.)
bottom [n.] Someone who takes it up the ass in sex. A.K.A. Daniel James Howell 受 (-Hey, is Dan top or bottom? -He's definitely a bottom. Have you seen him?!)
cootchie [n.] female genitalia
cherry pie [] A virgin's pussy

"Go fuck ten other women" is the most commonly prescribed treatment for this "disease" (hence the "itis"), as it tends to show quite quickly how very alike people are. In other words, get over yourself and your obsession with that girl, because it's just an illusion. And when you get rejected, don't be depressed. Because there's really not much to worry about. (Dude, you definitely have oneitis for that girl. You've been talking about her nonstop for the past week. Don't you realize she's nothing special, and that you are just being fooled? Snap out of it so you won't be so depressed when she rejects you!)
penetration [n.] Penetration is the medical term for the penis entering into the vagina. It's a good way term for talking about sex if one wants to seem mature. Even if you're a dirty little pervert, you'll sound like sex is more than just an emotionless action caused by hormones if you call it 'penetration' rather than 'fucking around', 'doing it' etc. (-Did you fucked your girlfriend last night? -Penetration occured and I deposited my semen inside of her vagina. -What the fuck? You're a frat boy, you don't talk like that. -I know, but I sure sound mature, don't I? )
rod [n.] an erect penis

Virgins, those on the rebound, and the emotionally fragile are more likely to have this term applied to them. Originally from the movie Wedding Crashers.

sus [adj.] The word sus is meant to suggest that someone is believed to be shady or false. They are hiding something or are believed to have a serious character flaw which makes them undesireble as friend or acqaintence. It is derived from its root word suspect.

Most commonly used to denote suspected homosexual tendencies.
